## Add an image to your post

Here are two ways you can add an image to your post - using Markdown syntax, and with inline HTML. Markdown syntax looks better, while Inline HTML gives you more control and is easier. I'll demonstrate both methods here, and you can pick the one most appropriate to you.


### Upload your image:

 1. Pick a free image upload site. I'd recommend [imgbb](https://imgbb.com/) (accessible in most countries) or [cubeupload](https://cubeupload.com/) (easier to use)
 2. Upload your image on the site. For demonstration purposes, I'm going to be using a [random PCA plot image I found online](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a0/PCA_plot_of_European_individuals.png). I've named the downloaded image file `pca_image.png`. Here's how to upload an image file on a couple of sites: ((cubeupload and imgbb upload screenshots))

On imgbb:

 - Click on the `Start Uploading` button on the home page.

 - Navigate to your image file in the dialog that pops up. Select your file and click `Open`
 <kbd>![Choose File](https://image.ibb.co/d4hK1c/02_browse.png)</kbd>
 - You should now see this upload screen. Click the `Upload` button.
 <kbd>![Ready to Upload](https://image.ibb.co/i7xmgc/03_selected.png)</kbd>
 <kbd></kbd>
 - You should now see this success message. Copy the link under `Viewer Links` (highlighted in pink) and open it in a new tab or window.

 - You should now be in the viewer window. Note the `About` and `Embed Codes` tabs in the lower left hand corner of the page.
 <kbd>![Viewer Page](https://image.ibb.co/gy5HnH/05_new_tab.png)</kbd>
 - Right click on the image and click on `Copy Image Address`. This is the **direct link** to the image. It should look something like this: `https://image.ibb.co/eMZArc/pca_image.png`
 <kbd>![Copy Image Address](https://image.ibb.co/iJWCMc/06_copy_image_address.png)</kbd> 
 - Click on the `Embed Codes` tab in the lower left hand side of the page. That should open up a set of links that looks like this:
 <kbd><![Embed codes](https://preview.ibb.co/dZsV7H/07_embed_code.png)/kbd>
 - Copy the highlighted `HTML` text under the `Full Image (linked)` section using the `Copy` hover option availabe when you click in the text box. This is the **embed code** for the image.

On Cubeupload:

 - Click on the `Select Images` button.
 <kbd>![Start Screen](https://image.ibb.co/ngSmgc/01_start.png)</kbd>
 -  Navigate to your file in the dialog that pops up and select the file and click on `Open` to choose the file.
 <kbd>![Select file](https://image.ibb.co/njme1c/02_browse.png)</kbd>
 - Click on `Start Upload` to upload the file
 <kbd>![Upload File](https://image.ibb.co/dOzMEx/03_ready_for_upload.png)</kbd>
 - Your screen should look like this now. Note the `Share` button highlighted in yellow. Click on the Share button
 <kbd>![Image Uploaded](https://image.ibb.co/jBzz1c/04_uploaded_share_highlighted.png)</kbd>
 - This is what you should see when you click the `Share` button. Note the part highlighted in blue - that is the **direct link** to the image.
 <kbd>![Click Share button](https://image.ibb.co/hcR1Ex/05_direct_links.png)</kbd>
 - Click on "Show Embed Codes". That will bring up a screen like the one below. Note the text under `HTML, full size` - this is the **embed code** for the image

#### a. Markdown method
 
   - This uses the **direct link** obtained from above.

   <kbd>![Embed code added](https://image.ibb.co/ium7nH/02_01_embed_code.png)</kbd>
   - **Advanced topic**: You can also modify the embed code and add more attributes to control size, alt-text, etc. See [this resource on HTML image tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp) to know how you can tweak your image. For example, I've adjusted the image width to 200 pixels here
