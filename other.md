DON'T USE TOPHAT - LIOR PACHTER TWEET
----

Hello <uname>,

You should know that the old 'Tuxedo' pipeline of Tophat(2) and Cufflinks is no longer the "advisable" tool for RNA-seq analysis. The software is deprecated/ in low maintenance and should be replaced by HISAT2, StringTie and ballgown. See this paper: [Transcript-level expression analysis of RNA-seq experiments with HISAT, StringTie and Ballgown][1].  There are also other alternatives, including alignment with STAR and bbmap, or pseudo-alignment using salmon.
